<li>- 15/02/2026: I worked on fesothe.com and updated some pages one was the open source page, I did some back end work on some personal domains eg jonathancurley.com adding email and redirects for w,ww,www,wwww,m, etc.
  I now add redirects for m.something as its been used in the past to enter a domain looking for a mobile page, as my websites are responsive the m subdomain is not needed but people still use it.</li>
<li>I bought opencircus.com and added a circus catagory to my open source catagories page on fesothe.com, opencircus.com will be for the development and open source sharing of circus entertainment, robotics, animatronics,
  costumes e.t.c that can be used to retire the use of animals in their circus.</li>
